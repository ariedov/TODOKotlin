TODOKotlin
==========


### The idea
The idea of the project is to create a todolist to plan your day. 
It is restricted to add tasks only for the net day.

### The realization
This is a totally test and messy project to work with Kotlin at the first place. 
I am planning to add some experimental Redux for state storing, Room for model stuff and Rx because it is cool.

If it ever goes to production I want to use Firebase data storage and Firebase google login for data sync and sharing your plans with others.

##### Pull requests much appreciated.
